To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ 0.0.5 has been released.
* Download at: 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10611

Z.C++ is now in stage 1 (new features).

New features in zcc
* extension: evaluation of typeid(...)==typeid(...) at compile-time when 
the types are known at compile time

Bugfixes in zcc
* sizeof("A") now works
* the any-order requirement for fundamental types whose type specifier 
requires more than one keyword is now implemented.

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not documented as intentional,
will be considered for blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2
(effectively blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.6).  Please report such bugs
immediately to zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de .  Reduced test cases
would be appreciated.

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
