To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ 0.0.3 has been released.
* Download at: 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10611

Z.C++ is now in stage 1 (new features)

New features
* extension macros:
** __COUNTER__ : GCC/CLang/MSVC
** __INCLUDE_LEVEL__ : GCC/CLang
** __TIMESTAMP__ : GCC/CLang/MSVC
** __has_include : CLang
* zcc changes
** new output mode: source transform
** static assertions (C1X: _Static_Assert(), C++0X static_assert)
** recognize but not yet parsing definitions of: enum, union, struct, class

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not documented as intentional, 
will be considered for blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2 
(effectively blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.3).  Please report such bugs 
immediately to zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de .  Reduced test cases 
would be appreciated.

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
