To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ 0.0.4 has been released.
* Download at: 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10611 .

Z.C++ is now in stage 1 (new features).

New features:
* full parsing of enumerators, and their use in expressions.
* very limited sizeof operator: expressions and non-cv-qualified 
fundamental types work. Pointers, structs, etc. don't work.

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not documented as intentional,
will be considered for blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2
(effectively blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.5).  Please report such bugs
immediately to zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de .  Reduced test cases
would be appreciated.

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
