To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ 0.0.8 has been released.
* Download at: 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10611

Z.C++ is now in stage 1 (new features).

New features in Z.C++
* Command-line option -E, for POSIX compatibility [preprocess only]

Bugfixes in Z.C++
* reject inappropriate use of _Thread_Local/thread_local storage 
qualification for file scope/namespace scope variables.

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not documented as intentional,
will be considered for blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2
(effectively blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.8).  Please report such bugs
immediately to zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de .  Reduced test cases
would be appreciated.

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
