To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ 0.0.6 has been released.
* Download at: 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10611

Z.C++ is now in stage 1 (new features).

Bugfixes in zcc:
* correct handling of primitive types with respect to order (e.g., long 
long unsigned int will be interpreted correctly)
* actually recognize const/volatile qualified structs/unions/classes 
with arbitrary ordering of const, volatile

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not documented as intentional,
will be considered for blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2
(effectively blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.7).  Please report such bugs
immediately to zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de .  Reduced test cases
would be appreciated.

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
