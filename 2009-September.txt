Subject: [Zcplusplus-announce] Z.C++ 0.0.2 release
Message-ID: <4AAB3CD5.6070907@zaimoni.com>

To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ 0.0.2 has been released.
* Download at: 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10611
* z_cpp should now be C99/C++0X compliant when the --pedantic option is 
used, aside from missing standard headers.
** __LINE__ directive now works (this bug slipped through Z.C++ 0.0.1 
through missing test case)
** LLONG_MIN no longer causes massive errors in evaluating #if/#elif 
control expressions.
** The only additional non-compliant behavior when the --pedantic option 
is omitted, should be the positive Golden Rule violation of erroring out 
on macro definitions that either automatically cause token concatenation 
errors when instantiated, or require an empty parameter to avoid an 
automatic token concatenation error.

Z.C++ is now in stage 1 (new features).

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not mentioned above, will be 
considered for blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2 (effectively 
blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.3).  Please report such bugs immediately 
to zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de .  Reduced test cases would be 
appreciated.

You may notice that zcc and cmp are included in the binary releases.  
They are included for completeness, not general usability.
* zcc currently is a vastly incomplete C99/C++0x syntax checker.
* cmp is a bare-bones partial reimplementation of POSIX 2/3 cmp.  It was 
included before it became obvious that the changes needed to allow 
building with MSVC 9.0 (Visual Studio 2008) were stage 1 changes.

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
