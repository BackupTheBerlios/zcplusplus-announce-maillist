To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ 0.0.9 has been released.
* Download at: 
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10611

Z.C++ is now in stage 1 (new features)

New features in Z.C++
* compiler extension __zcc_linkage, for evaluation of identifier linkage 
at compile time.  Needed to make linkage testable.  Evaluates as
** -2: bug prevented evaluation
** -1: identifier not defined at all
** 0: identifier has no linkage
** 1: identifier has internal linkage (e.g., declared static)
** 2: identifier has native external linkage (C for C, C++ for C++)
** 3: identifier has non-native external C linkage (not implemented yet)

Bugfixes
* #if 9<=10000*__ZCC__+100*__ZCC_MINOR__+__ZCC_PATCHLEVEL__ works as 
expected
* C keyword changes: _Static_assert rather than _Static_Assert, 
_Thread_local rather than _Thread_local

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not documented as intentional, 
will be considered for blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2 
(effectively blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.10).  Please report such bugs 
immediately to zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de .  Reduced test cases 
would be appreciated.

Kenneth
